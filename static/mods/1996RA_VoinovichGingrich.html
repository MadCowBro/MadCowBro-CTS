Many cheered as your fellow Ohioans saw you carry the mantle of the Republican party as best you could, but the results were incredibly close. It was around 1 or 2 in the morning when the call came in.</p>

<p>"We can now project, George Victor Voinovich has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>Cheers erupt in shock, elation, something positive at least. The Republican Party seemed dead in the water for when this election rolled around. It seemed like America was headed towards an inevitable Democratic victory. Sixteen years of Republican leadership in the White House certainly made many think that change would come no matter what. Victory was unlikely, but you reversed the course. For the first time in history, Republicans will hold the Presidency for twenty straight years. If 2000 goes well, perhaps even twenty-four years in a row, but that's far from your mind right now. The returns show you'll have your work cut out for you though as the House and Senate will remain in Democratic hands and you'll have to probably cooperate as best you can for these next four years. One of your staffers comes to you to inform you that Al Gore has called you.</p>

<p>He sounds tired, defeated as he offers his concession. He tells you that he wishes you luck in office and that he looks forward to seeing what you'll do in Washington. He keeps the conversation brief and ends the phone call soon after.</p>

<p>This is a stunning turn of events. To some, it's going to be seen as nothing short of a miracle, but you think that's overblowing it. You had faith in your campaign and you knew that if you kept to it, America would see things your way. Now here you are, the President-elect. You were unsure about running for the Presidency, but you've made the most of it. The trajectory of your career going from being a member of the Ohio House, to Mayor of Cleveland, to Governor of Ohio, and now the President of the United States. It's time to address the nation and everyone here. You head up to a microphone on a stage in the hall as you announce your victory.</p>

<p>"We can now project, George Victor Voinovich has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>There were some cheers, but the celebrations already had begun once things became clear. There would be twenty years of Republicans in the White House now through your efforts. The tides were against you, but you pushed through. It's all been leading up to this moment. Despite your reservations and uncertainty at the onset of your campaign, you'd done it. The Democrats lead in both the House and Senate have shrunk, so you'll still need to rely on bipartisan cooperation to actually push your agenda through, but that's always been your brand of leadership anyhow. The job is done, but now there's more work for you to do in Washington. One of your staffers comes to you to inform you that Al Gore is calling you to offer his concession.</p>

<p>He sounds immensely disappointed, but he's trying to take it as best he can. You and him crack a couple jokes about not becoming a lame duck President given the House and Senate makeup. You both have a polite conversation before he ends the call.</p>

<p>You've got a whole hall filled with your supporters, people who've had your back for years. In this moment, you are more than just their Governor, you're a hero for the Republican Party. A party that seemed to be slow walking into a certain defeat was instead renewed through your efforts. Hopefully you'll be able to live up to your predecessors and be reelected come 2000, but for now, you'll focus on making the most of these next four years of your political life as impactful and meaningful as you can. Your supporters might have quieted down, but they still should hear from you now. As you walk onto the stage and speak into the microphone, you know that this was a well fought victory for you.</p>

<p>"We can now project, George Victor Voinovich has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>The crowd here is ecstatic. Hell, you're ecstatic too. After all, the Republicans were thought to be dead in the water a year ago, especially after sixteen consecutive years of holding the Presidency, but now? Now they were going to hold the office for two decades in a row. It's unprecedented for the Republican Party. Your achievement here will likely be debated and studied for years to come, but right now you're not thinking about legacy. You're only thinking about what you'll be getting done to help the American people once you're in the Oval Office. The Senate is still in Democratic hands, though smaller than it was before. The House however is yours now, even if the Speaker position will be up for grabs with Gingrich leaving the picture in January. A staffer alerts you that Al Gore has been calling you.</p>

<p>He sounds shocked, disappointed, any word that can describe not understanding how this happened. You tell him you're thrilled, but you won't rub salt in the wound at least. You try to exchange pleasantries and give Gore a silver lining to the results, but he just hangs up soon after.</p>

<p>You hardly can believe this turn of events, but this puts you and the Republican Party in a completely new situation. One where even after party fatigue it was able to prevail. You're already being hailed as a hero for the Republican Party and everyone here in Columbus is cheering you on as such. The only thing that leaves you saddened is having to end your work in Ohio early, but you know you'll be able to do so much more for America on the whole. Everyone in America should hear from you soon, you are officially the next President after all. Heading onto the stage and ready to speak into the microphone, you know it's time.</p>

<p>"We can now project, George Victor Voinovich has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>And there it was. Everyone in the room erupted at the call. You can't blame them, you're just as overjoyed to have such a dominant win as this. Four of the last five Presidential elections went to the Republicans and in absolute landslides, and each of those four had a Republican winning at least 400 electoral votes. You've entered historic territory with this result. Some are already calling you the new face of the Republican Party. The House easily fell to the Republicans. The Senate was too out of play for you to win, but you've narrowed it down significantly. You'll be able to have a lot of leverage the next four years, maybe more if you play your cards right. A staffer tries to get your attention, telling you that Al Gore has been trying to call you.</p>

<p>He sounds distraught. He might even be stunned silent were he not telling you congratulations. He doesn't let you get a word in as he tells you good luck as President before ending the call.</p>

<p>You smile. It wasn't ever your plan to try running for President, but now? You can't say that you wished you did anything else. This is historic. This is your moment. Everyone here believed in you and you knocked it out of the park. This was beyond anyone's wildest expectations for you or any Republican. They'd have been laughed out of the room for suggesting this as a possibility. Now? They'd be lauded for being so on the money. Everyone here is on their feet and they deserve to hear from the next President right away. Strolling up to the stage and the microphone, you begin your victory speech.</p>

<p>"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>There's a sense of disappointment. That wasn't much of a surprise, even if things looked to be better than expected. You ultimately were seen as the best chance to pull off a miracle and you couldn't. Few within the Republican Party can really blame you however, there simply was too much against you this year. The silver lining at least is that the majorities in both chambers of Congress shrunk a bit so Gore will have less leverage to enact his agenda. Even so, you can't help but wonder if this was worth it to enter the race if it meant coming up short. Still, you keep your head up high. You decide now is a good time to call the soon-to-be President.</p>

<p>Gore sounds happy, if tired, though you admit that the excitement of the night and all the campaigning has left you exhausted as well. You congratulate him and he tells you that he hopes you keep up the good work in Ohio while he does his best for America. You end the call soon after.</p>

<p>This kind of loss hurts a bit, but you accept it. You'll have the next two years to do everything you can to help Ohio. After that? Maybe you'll run for Senate, John Glenn seems to be looking towards retirement and you carry strong approval ratings. It would certainly be something to consider. Tonight though you'll have to think about this loss. Many in the Republican Party will be, this is the first Presidential loss they've had since 1976. Until then, you'll need to give a speech for your concession. It's the least you can do after the lengthy proceedings, everyone here deserves to hear it now.

At midnight, the call came in.</p>

<p>"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>No one at this point seemed shocked to hear these words. While there was certainly some hope, it's clear that much of everyone was ready to hear the inevitable. You weren't going to be President and you can't say you're shocked. Everything seemed to be building to this point, even if you tried your best to stop it. You at least were able to prevent anything from getting too out of hand for the Republicans as the Democrats only barely gained in the House and lost a couple seats in the Senate, but beyond that there's little else to say. You lost and everyone moves on. Whether it was the right call for you to run in the first place is irrelevant now. You decide now is the right time to give the next President a phone call.</p>

<p>You offer your concession, trying not to sound too upset about the proceedings. You do wish him the best of luck as President though while he wishes you the best as you get back to running Ohio. The call ends soon after.</p>

<p>You can't say you're too upset, but even after your initial hesitation to run, you did put a lot of work into this campaign. You have a right to be upset after all the time and effort you put in. Ohio will still be your first priority though as you have two more years as Governor and after that, who knows? You doubt you'll ever run for President again, but you still have a lot you can do to serve America you feel. Whatever the case, you need to think about that later. Right now, there are loyal Ohioans that would like to hear their governor speak. And so you will, heading up to the stage and the microphone, ready to officially concede the election.</p>

It was only about 11 when the official call came in.</p>

<p>"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>There was a large amount of disappointment. For the Republican Party, the ones who had so much success since 1980, to have their time in the Oval Office end in a landslide was demoralizing. After the dominance of the 1980s and the narrow victory in 1992, it ended in a thud. You can't help but feel responsible. You were asked to be the one to carry this nomination, seen as the one who could avoid disaster. Disaster came anyway, maybe that was your fault or something else. At the end of the day though, you've lost this election. The House and Senate both has gains for the Democrats, so Gore will have more leverage to pass his agenda. You realize at that moment that you still need to give him a phone call.</p>

<p>Gore sounds delighted, though you can tell he's not going to try and gloat. You still feel disappointment all the same. You wish him luck for the next four years and he wishes you the same as you get back to Ohio. You hang up right after that.</p>

<p>Where do you go from here? You have the rest of your term as governor, but after that? You doubt you can really run for another position like the Senate after this performance. That's all in the future though. The Republicans hadn't lost in a landslide since 1964 and times had changed a lot since then. Maybe expecting to be able to win a fifth term in a row for the party was wishful thinking. Maybe you weren't cut out for running for President and you should've just let someone else bear the brunt of this loss. Regardless, you've got people waiting for you to speak. They deserve to hear you, even if you feel they'll be upset at you for what's happened. Walking onto the stage and up the microphone, you begin your concession.</p>

The Republican Party seemed dead in the water for when this election rolled around. It seemed like America was headed towards an inevitable Democratic victory. Sixteen years of Republican leadership in the White House certainly made many think that change would come no matter what. Victory was unlikely, but you reversed the course. For the first time in history, Republicans will hold the Presidency for twenty straight years. If 2000 goes well, perhaps even twenty-four years in a row, but that's far from your mind right now. The returns show you'll have your work cut out for you though as the House and Senate will remain in Democratic hands and you'll have to probably cooperate as best you can for these next four years. One of your staffers comes to you to inform you that Al Gore has called you.</p>\n\n<p>He sounds tired, defeated as he offers his concession. He tells you that he wishes you luck in office and that he looks forward to seeing what you'll do in Washington. He keeps the conversation brief and ends the phone call soon after.</p>\n\n<p>This is a stunning turn of events. To some, it's going to be seen as nothing short of a miracle, but you think that's overblowing it. You had faith in your campaign and you knew that if you kept to it, America would see things your way. Now here you are, the President-elect. You were unsure about running for the Presidency, but you've made the most of it. The trajectory of your career going from being a member of the Ohio House, to Mayor of Cleveland, to Governor of Ohio, and now the President of the United States. It's time to address the nation and everyone here. You head up to a microphone on a stage in the hall as you announce your victory.</p>\n\n<p>\"My fellow Americans...\"</p>",

There would be twenty years of Republicans in the White House now through your efforts. The tides were against you, but you pushed through. It's all been leading up to this moment. Despite your reservations and uncertainty at the onset of your campaign, you'd done it. The Democrats lead in both the House and Senate have shrunk, so you'll still need to rely on bipartisan cooperation to actually push your agenda through, but that's always been your brand of leadership anyhow. The job is done, but now there's more work for you to do in Washington. One of your staffers comes to you to inform you that Al Gore is calling you to offer his concession.</p>\n\n<p>He sounds immensely disappointed, but he's trying to take it as best he can. You and him crack a couple jokes about not becoming a lame duck President given the House and Senate makeup. You both have a polite conversation before he ends the call.</p>\n\n<p>You've got a whole hall filled with your supporters, people who've had your back for years. In this moment, you are more than just their Governor, you're a hero for the Republican Party. A party that seemed to be slow walking into a certain defeat was instead renewed through your efforts. Hopefully you'll be able to live up to your predecessors and be reelected come 2000, but for now, you'll focus on making the most of these next four years of your political life as impactful and meaningful as you can. Your supporters might have quieted down, but they still should hear from you now.

You're only thinking about what you'll be getting done to help the American people once you're in the Oval Office. The Senate is still in Democratic hands, though smaller than it was before.

One where even after party fatigue it was able to prevail. You're already being hailed as a hero for the Republican Party and everyone here in Columbus is cheering you on as such.

Four of the last five Presidential elections went to the Republicans and in absolute landslides, and each of those four had a Republican winning at least 400 electoral votes. You've entered historic territory with this result. Some are already calling you the new face of the Republican Party. The House easily fell to the Republicans. The Senate was too out of play for you to win, but you've narrowed it down significantly. You'll be able to have a lot of leverage the next four years, maybe more if you play your cards right. A staffer tries to get your attention, telling you that Al Gore has been trying to call you.</p>\n\n<p>He sounds distraught. He might even be stunned silent were he not telling you congratulations.

You can't say that you wished you did anything else. This is historic. This is your moment. Everyone here believed in you and you knocked it out of the park. This was beyond anyone's wildest expectations for you or any Republican. They'd have been laughed out of the room for suggesting this as a possibility. Now? They'd be lauded for being so on the money. Everyone here is on their feet and they deserve to hear from the next President right away.

Tonight though you'll have to think about this loss. Many in the Republican Party will be, this is the first Presidential loss they've had since 1976. Until then, you'll need to give a speech for your concession. It's the least you can do after the lengthy proceedings, everyone here deserves to hear it now.
