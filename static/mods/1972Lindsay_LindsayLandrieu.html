The next day, you don't even want to get out of bed, but you must.

Despite the poor result, this was more or less where most Nixon-optimistic folks hoped you'd end up. Managing to underperform in an election where underperforming was expected.

You come up to bat, heart racing and mind pumping, he launches the ball and you hit it! You've hit it so far! Only for centerfield to make a leaping catch, dashing your hopes and forcing you to walk back to the dugout. But New York City is the audience that was rooting for you.

But soon after that, things slowed, your momentum stalled, and it soon became apparent that Nixon's overwhelming popularity caught up to you.

New York City has more or less rallide around you in the wake of your loss, so maybe getting some uncertain pieces of legislation through while you have the opportunity is smart.

If you remain within the goodwill of the party from now and between four years, you could definitely give it another go! Yes, you'll have to win the primaries, and convince those who didn't support you that you're much more viable now.

Even though you ultimately came up short after the dust settled, you've committed a monumental feat, bringing Nixon's margin of victory possibly even closer than 1968.

If you remain popular throughout these four years, potentially running for another term as New York City mayor, you could certainly keep yourself in the national spotlight up until then.
