Many states still have their own specific laws for how they choose who to vote for for president.</p><p>Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia all chose who they were going to vote for based on a popular vote in most cases severely limited by stringent property requirements. Thus, on the map, the percentages of support each candidate has in those states will represent their percentage of popular vote.</p><p>In Illinois and Maryland, voters were divided into districts and whoever gets a plurality of the popular vote within their district gets that district’s electoral vote(s). In the TCT engine, the states themselves have 0 electoral votes, but the individual districts (which are not visible on the map) have the number of electoral votes they had historically. In 1824, Illinois had <b>three</b> electoral votes split across three districts and Maryland had <b>eleven</b> electoral votes split across nine districts. The percentages of support each candidate has in Illinois and Maryland indicate their support within the state as a whole.</p><p>In Connecticut, Georgia, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Vermont, whichever candidate has a plurality of support within the state legislature wins all of the state’s electoral votes. For this reason, the levels of support the candidates have in those states indicate their support within the state legislatures.</p><p>In Delaware, Louisiana, and New York, the state legislature chose who the state was going to cast its electoral votes for. As previously, the percentages of support each candidate has in those states indicate their support within the state legislature. However, because of how divided these state legislatures were in the election of 1824, they will work slightly differently from the previous category. If any candidate establishes a majority in the legislatures of New York and Louisiana, they win all of that state’s electoral votes. But, if no one has a majority, candidates will have to make deals with each other to establish a majority. Delaware had a unique electoral system represented by a proportional distribution of electoral votes between the top two candidates.</p><button onclick='backinfo1()'>INFO: General Election</button></div></span>\", \"image_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/zkdBigx.png\", \"winning_electoral_vote_number\": 131, \"advisor_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/Swpgs7H.png\", \"recommended_reading\": \"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:357.133px;font-size:1em;'><h4 style='margin-top: 0.5em;'>The Election of 1824</h4>David P.

Crawford rose in prominence quickly, becoming President Pro Tempore in 1811, Minister to France in 1813, Secretary of War in 1815, and Secretary of Treasury in 1816.</p><p>One of Crawford’s greatest strengths is his ability to win support among party leaders. In 1816, his supporters were so powerful that they almost denied Monroe the Democratic-Republican nomination, and likely would have succeeded, had Crawford pushed for the presidency harder.

His strong support for the National Bank in the past has made him look even worse. However, Crawford’s persistent advocacy for the reduction of government spending has made him a champion of the southern “Old Republicans”, supporters of small government and states’ rights.</p></p><button onclick='back2()'>Back</button></p></span></p>\", \"color_hex\": \"#DA291C\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#DA291C\", \"is_active\": 1, \"image_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/TId5Xc5.png\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"'\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"'\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"'\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"'\", \"candidate_score\": 1.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 300, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"John C.\", \"last_name\": \"Calhoun\", \"election\": 20, \"party\": \"Democratic-Republican\", \"state\": \"South Carolina\", \"priority\": 1, \"description\": \"<span id='screen8' style='display: initial;'><p><b>THIS CANDIDATE IS NOT PLAYABLE</b></p><p>The youngest man running this year, 38-year old John C.

Secretary Calhoun immediately started reforming the Department of War, creating a bureau system, establishing a more clear chain of command for the army, building multiple new forts to protect from further invasion, and purchasing weapons, supplies, and medical care that the army previously lacked.

On his very first day in the House, the 32 year old Clay was elected the youngest Speaker of the House in history. Over the next 10 years, Clay would refashion his position into one with great political power. Unlike past Speakers, Clay set the House agenda, directed legislation to specific committees, controlled debate, and had extensive control behind the scenes.</p><p>Clay’s status as a leading “warhawk” and his role in negotiating the Treaty of Ghent brought him great national renown. Clay quickly became the Monroe administration’s most fervent critic, denouncing Adams’ Adams-Onis Treaty with Spain and demanding recognition for the South American republics. While Clay lost these battles, his opposition to the administration still raised his public profile. <button onclick='next3()'>More</button></p></span><span id='screen7' style='display: none;'></p><p>Yet, Clay has problems as well. Unlike Adams, Crawford, and Calhoun, he does not have a strong political organization to aid him in his quest for the presidency. Furthermore, Clay’s position as Speaker of the House has forced him to take positions on unpopular issues. This was most apparent in 1820, when Clay negotiated a monumental compromise admitting Missouri to the Union as a slave state in exchange for Maine splitting off of Massachusetts as a free state. While this compromise may have saved the Union, it left both southerners and northerners unhappy.</p><p>Leaving the House in 1821 for financial reasons, Clay now has a choice.

This earned him the nickname “Hero of New Orleans” and some newspapers immediately started touting him as a potential candidate for the presidency.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jackson’s further ventures were far more controversial.
