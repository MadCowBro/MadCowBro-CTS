John Wilkes Booth bullet nearly severed President Lincoln’s spine, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Left to lead a nation from his wheelchair, as his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton hastily puts together a plan to stitch the Union back together. Lincoln battles a war weary nation, a disintegrating family, and his own depression which he masks with his typical dry wit. Seeing no one as his natural successor, Lincoln forgoes another term and picks Stanton to carry the torch. 1868 is a battle for the soul do the nation. One of many in post-antebellum America.<ul><li>Edwin Stanton must forge his own path to the presidency, either by following Lincoln’s vision or pursuing reconciliation or radical reconstruction.</li><li>The Democrats are teetering on the brink. However, the minor skirmish within the GOP gives them hope they can position themselves as the sane party.</ul>",
