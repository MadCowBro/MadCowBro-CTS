I’ve spent plenty of time just tryin’ to keep my hat from blowin’ off. Just be yerself. The folks need a leader, not a painted picture.”<br><br>Stanton’s brow furrowed with unease. “But I can’t do this alone.”<br><br>“Then don’t go it alone,” Lincoln urged, steady yet gentle. “You’ve got the whole nation behind ya—grumblin’, sure, but still behind ya.

You held this nation together while I lay a-recoverin’, and that’s why I placed my trust in ya.”<br><br>As their hands clasped in silent solidarity, a weighty understanding passed between them: the burden was heavy, but Stanton was ready to bear it.

His trust in Stanton blinded him to his declining health. Worse yet, he rejected his advice on who to select for a running mate. Lincoln demanded Colfax and inherited the wind. While Colfax's Radical Republican credentials were impeccable, his involvement in the Credit Mobilier scandal would ultimately paralyze the federal government's Reconstruction efforts at their most crucial moment.<br><br>Living until 1874, Lincoln witnessed the unraveling of his carefully constructed Reconstruction framework. His final years were marked by increasing physical frailty but maintained mental acuity, allowing him to fully comprehend the consequences of his succession decisions.<br><br>All Lincoln could do is watch.
